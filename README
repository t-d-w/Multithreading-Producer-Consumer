A basic guide to our implementation of the project:
 - The main file is Main.c. It contains the main method, which handles the creation and interactions of the Reader, Munch1, Munch2,and Writer threads.
 - Reader.c, read each input line from stdin and throw away the line that exceed the buffer size
 - MunchAndWrite.c, it handles the enqueue and dequeue actions in munch1 and munch2 thread.
 - QueueStats, print out the stats of queues, such as enqueueCount, dequeCount, enqueueTime and dequeueTime.
